## Designated Market Makers for the Lumber Futures Market

Using the Historical Daily Spot Prices and Monthly Precipitation Amount data we calculated a fair value of the lumber futures contracts. The specific model we built was an ARIMA model to do this. We then implemented a series of market-making functions we thought was necessary to adhere to the risk limits, effectively fade the rest of the market makers, and execute on the optimal spreads. 
In this case we placed 14th from the 40 teams that we were competing against.
